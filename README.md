## Executive Summary

The project aims to assist the editors of the food magazine "Eat Safe, Love" in analyzing food hygiene ratings data to guide their future articles. By leveraging MongoDB and PyMongo, we established a database named "uk_food" with a collection named "establishments" containing information about various food establishments across the United Kingdom. We performed data import, database setup, data updates, and exploratory analysis to derive insights that would help prioritize locations for future articles.
